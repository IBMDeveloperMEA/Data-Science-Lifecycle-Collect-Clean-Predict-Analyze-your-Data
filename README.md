## About the workshop 
AutoAI is a capability that automates machine learning tasks to ease the tasks of data scientists. It automatically prepares your data for modeling, chooses the best algorithm for your problem, and creates pipelines for the trained models, and it can be run in public clouds and in private clouds, including IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

This tutorial explains the benefits of the AutoAI service on a use case. This will give you a better understanding of how regression and classification problems can be handled without any code â€” and how the tasks (feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.) are done with this service. This tutorial also includes details for choosing the best model among the pipelines and how to deploy and use these models via IBM Cloud Pak for Data platform.

Customer churn is an important aspect for any business, it gives them insights about their prospective customers. In this tutorial we will be predicting customer churn of car owners. We will be utilizing Watson data refinery to alter our data, and then use AutoAI to rapdliy develop a classfication machine learning model in a matter of minutes and predict our customer chrun.

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Create Cloud Pak for Data as a Service (Watson Studio)
 On top of the page, you will see a search bar. Search for "Watson Studio". Watson Studio service will show up. Click on it, if you already have an instance of Watson Studio, it should be visible. If so, click it. If not, click Watson Studio under Catalog Results to create a new service instance.

Select the type of plan to create if you are creating a new service instance. A Lite (free) plan should suffice for this tutorial). Click Create.

### Step 2. Create Object Storage

Search for "Object Storage". Object Storage service will show up. Click on it. If you already have an instance of Object Storage, it should be visible. If so, click it. If not, click Object Storage under Catalog Results to create a new service instance.

### Step 3. Create a Watson Machine Learning Service instance

To create a Watson Machine Learning instance, search for Machine Learning and create a lite instance. If you already have an instance of Machine Learning, it should be visible. If so, click it. If not, click Machine Learning under Catalog Results to create a new service instance.
